		<p>Here you will be presented with 30 pairs of sound clips. We ask you to listen to and compare the two sound clips, and answer the following two questions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Which of the two sound clips sound like a guitar?</li>
			<li>How similar do the two clips sound?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For the first question you will be given two choices, and you can choose the one that sounds more chilled to your taste. For the latter, you will be given a Likert scale, from 'Very Different' to 'Very Simliar'; please choose the option that describes the two clips best. You can listen to both clips as many times as you require to make your choice.</p>
