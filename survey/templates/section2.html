		<p>In this section, you will again be presented with 8 pairs of sound clips, that are either original or generated from a neural network. This neural network was trained to translate the guitar sounds to those of piano. Please answer the following questions after listening to each pair. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>How similar does the sound clip sound to a piano?</li>
			<li>How similar do the two clips sound?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For the first question you will be given two choices, and you can choose the one that sounds more chilled to your taste. For the latter, you will be given a Likert scale, from 'Very Different' to 'Very Simliar'; please choose the option that describes the two clips best. You can listen to both clips as many times as you require to make your choice.</p>
