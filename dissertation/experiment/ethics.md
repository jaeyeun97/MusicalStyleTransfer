Type of study: controlled experiments for technology evaluation
Funding Body: None

Brief Description:

This experiment aims to evaluate whether or not this neural network successfully "chillified" and/or performed timbre transform on the given musical sound source. In order to verify that the neural network has achieved its goals, I intend to ask a group of students and members of the King's Voices to listen to clips generated by the neural network along with the originals in a form of an online questionnaire. Each participant will be instructed and guided through the experiment in person in case of any unforeseen problems or questions, and the results will be aggregated once by the server and by hand for any system failure.

Precautions taken:

* Each participant will be given a consent form which affirms:
	- that they are allowed to withdraw at any point in the experiment,
	- that their data will be anonymised,
	- that they can obtain results or any further information of the experiment,
* No personal data of participants will be obtained nor released
* Questionnaires will include a disambiguation of terms that may be unclear, such as "chillify", using a set of sample sound clips
* Each participant will be given a piece of chocolate for their help!
