abstract = {Generative source separation methods such as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) or auto-encoders, rely on the assumption of an output probability density. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can learn data distributions without needing a parametric assumption on the output density. We show on a speech source separation experiment that, a multi-layer perceptron trained with a Wasserstein-GAN formulation outperforms NMF, auto-encoders trained with maximum likelihood, and variational auto-encoders in terms of source to distortion ratio.},

abstract = {Content-based music information retrieval tasks have traditionally been solved using engineered features and shallow processing architectures. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in using feature learning and deep architectures instead, thus reducing the required engineering effort and the need for prior knowledge. However, this new approach typically still relies on mid-level representations of music audio, e.g. spectrograms, instead of raw audio signals. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to apply feature learning directly to raw audio signals. We train convolutional neural networks using both approaches and compare their performance on an automatic tagging task. Although they do not outperform a spectrogram-based approach, the networks are able to autonomously discover frequency decompositions from raw audio, as well as phase-and translation-invariant feature representations.},
